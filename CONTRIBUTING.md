# How to report issues/bugs?

Create an issue on Github, we will try to get back to you ASAP.

# Checkout the code

```
git clone https://github.com/NordSecurity/uniffi-bindgen-cs.git
cd uniffi-bindgen-cs
git submodule update --init --recursive
```


# Committing rules

[DCO](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/) sign off is enforced for all commits. Be sure to use the `-s` option to add a `Signed-off-by` line to your commit messages.

```
git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'
```

# Run tests

To run tests, `dotnet` installation is required. Unlike `uniffi-rs`, there is no integration with
`cargo test`. Tests are written using `xunit`.

- Build `uniffi-bindgen-cs` executable, and `libuniffi_fixtures.so` shared library.
    ```
    ./build.sh
    ```

- Generate test bindings using `uniffi-bindgen-cs`, and run `dotnet test` command.
    ```
    ./test_bindings.sh
    ```

# Run tests in Docker

Running tests in Docker containers is easier, because manual `dotnet` installation is not required.

```
./docker_build.sh
./docker_test_bindings.sh
```
